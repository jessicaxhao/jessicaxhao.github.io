                <div class="content-to-populate-in-modal" id="modal-content-1J">
                  <h1>Jessica Hao</h1>
                  <div class="biography-pop-up feature-paragraph">
                    <p>
                      You would never hear her say it but Jessica Meng Jia Hao is a straight-up badass. Her utter bad-assery can be seen in many aspects of her life, from how she eats a dozen raw eggs (blended thoroughly with whey protein of course) for breakfast to how she brawls at the end of her beloved Chicago Blackhawks’ hockey games, regardless of whether or not they won. She excels at not taking any bullshit from anyone, putting uppity and self-righteous people in their place, and pushing herself to her limits in everything that she does, whether it’s school, working out or slaughtering her enemies.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Jessica was born in Beijing, China and moved to Ontario, Canada when she was six. Her family lived there until she was 13, when they moved back to China, this time to Shanghai. In that time, her younger brother, Coen, was born and rapidly proved himself to be the more academically competent of the two children, racing past his older sister in reading level and mathematical aptitude.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                     As a small she-child, Jess always looked longingly across the Ambassador Bridge, the bridge that connected her hometown of Windsor to Detroit, at the United States of America, the place that she loves with all of her heart. America, with all of its liberty, truly conservative politics and none of those pesky taxes or public services like free universal healthcare (ewww), was truly where she longed to be.
                   </p>

                   <p>
                     However, it was not until she graduated from the Shanghai American School (a subconscious nod to her love of her soon to be adopted country?) that she was able to achieve her dream of living in America. She attended “just another school in New Jersey” where she studied “not a real science” on her way to becoming a doctor. She worked very hard, rarely partying or interacting with boys because, let’s face it, boys are gross. She now attends medical school at Washington University, with the long-term goal of being a stay-at-home trophy mom.
                   </p>

                   <p>
                    Some fun facts about Jess that are sure to be great conversation starters when you see her at the wedding include:
                  </p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Jess loves talking about cars, particularly foreign made, practical and economically-sensible sedans; she dreams about one day owning a responsible and fuel-efficient Toyota Camry.
                    </li>

                    <li>History has always been one of Jess’s favorite subjects; she definitely knows when World War II occurred and can definitely tell you who fought whom in said war.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Country music is what lives in Jess’s soul; some of her favorite tracks include “I lost my tractor and now my heart is broken” and “My girl’s been sleeping with my horses and that’s okay”.
                    </li>

                  </ul>

                <div class="content-to-populate-in-modal" id="modal-content-1H">
                  <h1>Henry Chai</h1>
                  <div class="biography-pop-up feature-paragraph">
                    <p>
                      Henry R. Chai is a sort of okay dude from basically Canada whose greatest life accomplishment thus far has been getting engaged to Jess. Henry grew up in the kind of small town that causes every kid who grows up there to write at least one song revolving around the themes of “being trapped in this awful place” and “needing to escape”. The status of the synthesizer that sits still preserved in his childhood bedroom suggests that Henry was no exception to this rule. This small town gave Henry a false sense of his value and worth in the world. His childhood successes in chess club, MathCounts, and the All-State orchestra led him to believe that he would be qualified to apply to the best university in the country. Luckily, a subsequent clerical error resulted in his acceptance.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      As a result, Henry graduated as a member of Princeton's Great Class of 2014. During his time on campus, he was known for his indecisiveness regarding his future major, his role in providing Dan Marks with the largest single on campus, and the fact that he had hands down the best Beirut partner in the universe. He currently lives in Boston, MA where he juggles his two full-time jobs as code-running slave at a boutique operations consulting firm and professional survivor of terrible soul-sucking New England winters. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      In his free time, Henry likes to talk about not talking about Eli Manning and denying the fact that he spends a substantive amount of his life singing the “Nationwide is on your side” song in his head in the other Manning’s voice. He generally partakes in these activities while participating in no less than 12 fantasy sports leagues at all times and losing in most of them every week by doing things like not starting Matthew Stafford on days when he goes for 30+ points. Henry’s incredible memory for sports-related statistics allows him to relive every one of the crushing defeats he brings upon himself week after week in vivid detail when he is not actively in the midst of compulsively watching RedZone.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Henry has a storied history in the world of video gaming. His glory days peaked during his college years of Tetris Friends but an aging mind and rapidly deteriorating reflexes required that he switch to a less fast-paced game more suitable to his present disabilities. Henry has since then made a small dent in the world of competitive Hearthstone, where he has posted a best finish of Rank 3 on the Ladder, exactly 3 ranks short of anything notable. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Outside of his E-sports pursuits, Henry is also an active role-player in a local Dungeons and Dragons group where he gets to live out his fantasies of being a monk with really great cooking abilities. DND allows Henry the opportunity to be someone he would otherwise never have the ability to be in the real world, like an individual with an actual moral compass, life goals, and self-sufficiency.
                    </p>

                            <p>I am 23 years old, living in San Mateo, CA, and working at a software company in the area. For fun I like playing games (card, board, and video), especially German-style board games. I did undergrad at Carnegie Mellon and grew up in Bangor, Maine. It was in high school that I met Henry. We had a lot of similar interests (math, soccer, chess, magic), and took nearly identical classes. Henry and I had a lot of fun together, but also had a lot of serious conversations about life, the future, and how many colors in a magic deck is too many colors (the answer is two). Although I'm a year older than Henry, he was always a couple years ahead of me in terms of maturity, and helped me through many tough times with great advice and support.

                              Facebook recently alerted me that I have been friends with Jess for over 8 years. Jess and I spent 4 of those years as classmates at SAS, and during the other four years, I moonlighted as a Princeton student (Forbes Lyf) at which time I met Henry — arguably the most generous man about to marry Jess that I know. The math works out so that I am going to be Jess’s Man of Honor. I am currently pursuing an MD at NYU, and in my free time I nap aggressively, fuss over my Instagram, try to keep up with illustration and cooking, and plan weddings, apparently. So any qualms about the wedding festivities can be directed my way — whether or not I read them is another matter entirely.

                          I met Henry either within or above the vaunted Wilcox Hall dining room. We bonded over meals and competitive Tetris before rooming together as upperclassmen. Though I still regret that Henry couldn’t duplicate himself so as to hang out with both Jess and myself without interruption during senior year, I find joy in this couple’s joy, and, try as I might, I cannot find it in myself to begrudge Jess for stealing my friend. In addition, I took the over, so I truly feel blessed with this arrangement! I hail from Denver, Colorado, but I spent the last two years teaching English at small college in south-central China.

                        <p style="line-height:1.2;">I met Jess my first day at Princeton during our CA orientation and I just remember thinking….this girl….is weird. But those always end up being the best kind of  friends don’t they? After Jess and I started getting closer and hanging out more, I could tell she was the type of person to be there for you whenever you needed someone and would never judge you for anything. And as the years past at Princeton, and friends slowly disappeared from my life, Jess never did, she was always there. She would be there for me just as I would be there for her, no matter what. And that’s exactly why I disliked Henry when he came into the picture. He just moseyed his way in and took my friend away, he took her heart, he took all of her. And if it weren’t for the fact that he is about to become her husband and keep making her as happy as she has been since meeting him, I might still dislike him. He is honestly a great guy, and just the perfect second half of Jess. I truly thank him for making her so damn happy. He has made this emo, jaded (yet still wonderful) girl into a softie with a constant radiant smile. I love you Jess and Henry and am so glad to be part of your wedding day.

At Princeton, I studied computer science and was involved in the ongoings of Charter (one of Princeton's eating clubs). I first met Henry during our sophomore year while he was narrating a game of mafia. The year after that, I met Jess during lunch one day at Charter, which, funnily enough, Henry happened to be present for as well. Little did I know that, at the time, the two be dating within a year! Henry and Jess are both very fun, genuine people, and I'm very grateful for the time we all spent hanging out with one another in college.  I'm very excited for the two of them and wish them all the best!</p>

                        <p>I met Jessica on a field trip in 9th grade. At the time, I thought she was kind of strange. As we got to know each other, I decided that she is incredibly strange- but in the best way. Jessica is fearlessly herself. She stands up for her opinions and her passions, and she always inspires me to do the same. After the wedding, I am attending law school to pursue environmental law, and I cannot wait to see everything that she and Henry achieve in this chapter of their lives.

                        <p>I'm a chemical engineer currently working in the chemicals industry as a process/production engineer. I have the honor of being a groomswoman for Henry, though I adore both halves of this couple! I have known Henry since freshman year of college, when he was a wee nerd like the rest of us. I'm proud of the man he's grown up to be, and of the adventures we've had getting there (Wilcox Crew for life!!).  Here's to many more adventures!

                          The first thing I remember about Henry when I met him our freshman year at Princeton was his bright orange hair (maybe it'll make a comeback at the wedding?). I recall our times in Wilcox where we'd spend too much time playing Tetris (and NTris!) or getting mad at each other when playing that Chinese card game. During our sophomore summer, we roomed together at Princeton and had a blast, with late-night talks and being beer pong partners. But I think we really bonded when we were in Charter; just hanging out in the UDR, doing our own work but also very willing to get distracted by Starcraft or Nertz. It was wonderful to see Henry and Jess' relationship really blossom during our time at Charter, and I wish them all the best! I am currently a first-year medical student at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, but am so excited to return back to Princeton for this wedding. :)

                          I met Jessica on a field trip in 9th grade. At the time, I thought she was kind of strange. As we got to know each other, I decided that she is incredibly strange- but in the best way. Jessica is fearlessly herself. She stands up for her opinions and her passions, and she always inspires me to do the same. After the wedding, I am attending law school to pursue environmental law, and I cannot wait to see everything that she and Henry achieve in this chapter of their lives.
